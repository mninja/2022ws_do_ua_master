# Organizational Models

Organizations are built with structures of operation in mind. These guidelines assist in planning and guiding how rules, roles and tasks, amounts of work, salaries and other types of resources are distributed and managed. The aim of a structure is to manage all these necessities in order for the organization to be able to meet its goals.
To achieve this most organizations, have different systems of models based on their needs. Some organizations are structured based on a central vision while others are decentralized in their agenda and function. 
Good examples into how these models vary and affect organizations, especially when it comes to how employees are paid, are three companies, [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/), [Sipgate](https://www.sipgate.co.uk/features) and [Buffer](https://buffer.com/).
[Buffer](https://buffer.com/salaries) operates on a structure focused on function and a centralized hierarchy system. This has impacted a great deal on how salaries are paid as employees in the same level of the hierarchy and experience are [“paid equitably”](https://buffer.com/resources/compensation-philosophy/#:~:text=experience%20level%20are-,paid%20equitably,-.) based on their salary formula. The hierarchy is based on function, skill, role and experience of the employee.
[Morningstar Inc.](https://www.payscale.com/research/IN/Employer=Morningstar%2C_Inc./Salary#:~:text=FAQs%20About%20Morningstar%2C%20Inc.) is an investment company that is heavily focused on technology while also operating as a technology company as well. Similar to the previous company it employs a function based centralized structure model in terms of roles, amount of work as well as salaries. This is evident given among the highly paid employees are software engineers, directors as well project managers, whose roles are critical to the organization. Salaries and tasks increase and decrease along the hierarchy depending on competencies of the employee in their position.
A company like [Sipgate](https://sipgate.medium.com/so-zahlen-wir-6251ec42205a) however offers a unique perspective into how structures shape salaries of employees. The organization is an online telecommunication service company. Their greatest focus is on offering quality service based on demand. With this goal in mind their salary structure also follows the same model with employees not being compensated based on a negotiated salary but based on the market demands. The various employee salary categories vary based on function and competencies of the individual and not the job category. This happens with employees of greater experience and skill set earning more than less skilled but qualified employees in the same job category.
